### [Project 1: Data Pipeline Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) , Reporting and Visualization](https://github.com/aiightvert/Pipeline-ETL-Reporting-Visualization)

**Description**

This group project simulates the full governance of a fictional UK-based retail store data. The goal is to process a raw big data from the company to generate useful information and insights that can support the business by fact-based supported decision. 
<br><br>

**Dataset**

The dataset is imported from UCI Machine Learning Repository from the URL <a href="https://github.com/aiightvert/Text-and-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Motorcycle-Review">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii</a> which contains 1.067.371 rows (which later to be cleansed to 824.364 rows) and 8 columns of various products informations and sales.

### [Project 2: Text and Sentiment Analysis for Motorcycle Online Marketplace Review](https://github.com/aiightvert/Text-and-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Motorcycle-Review)

**Description**

This project is based on text analysis regarding customer review with the purchase of a motorcycle from various Indonesian Online Marketplace (Tokopedia, Shopee, etc.). The scope of this project is divided by two objectives. The first objective is to find the most frequent keywords used by customer to define their purchase of the product using wordcloud. The second objective is to create a machine learning system that can define the sentiment (positive/negative) of a customer review based on their comment using ratings as parameters (weight) decision.
<br><br>

**Dataset**

The dataset is self-collected and mined by myself through various visit to multiple marketplace and seller's page to produce an excel format (will be converted to .csv while exporting). It contains 202 rows and 5 columns of data.

**Tools**
- Excel
- Python

**Methods**
- Text Data Pre-processing (Stemming, Lemmatization, etc.)
- Wordcloud
- Naive Bayes for machine learning : Bernoulli Model

**Scope 1**

The result of the second scope generated a machine learning model that able to predict customer's sentiment (positive/negative) regarding a product based on their review comment up to a 97% accuracy.

**Tools**
- Python
- Matlab

**Methods**
- Black Scholes Merton Model
- Heston (Implied Volatility) Model
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
