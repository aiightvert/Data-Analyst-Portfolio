### [Project 1: Text and Sentiment Analysis for Motorcycle Online Marketplace Review](https://github.com/aiightvert/Text-and-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Motorcycle-Review)

**Description**
This project is based on text analysis regarding customer review with the purchase of a motorcycle from various Indonesian Online Marketplace (Tokopedia, Shopee, etc.). The scope of this project is divided by two objectives. The first objective is to find the most frequent keywords used by customer to define their purchase of the product using wordcloud. The second objective is to create a machine learning system that can define the sentiment (positive/negative) of a customer review based on their comment using ratings as parameters (weight) decision.

**Dataset**
The dataset is self-collected and mined by myself through various visit to multiple marketplace and seller's page to produce an excel format (will be converted to csv. while exporting). It contains 202 rows and 5 columns of data.
